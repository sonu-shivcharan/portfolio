# Tiffinz — Case Study

## Overview

**Tiffinz** is a full-stack web application designed to modernize the way local tiffin services operate.  
The platform focuses on automating meal tracking, wallet management, and delivery workflows while keeping the system simple for both users and administrators.

---

## Problem

Most local tiffin services manage their operations using:

- Manual registers
- WhatsApp messages
- Verbal confirmations

This approach leads to:

- Payment tracking errors
- No clear wallet balance for users
- Difficulty handling cancellations and adjustments
- Poor scalability as the number of customers grows

---

## Goal

The goal of Tiffinz was to:

- Provide transparent wallet and transaction tracking
- Automate daily meal status updates
- Simplify admin operations
- Build a system that can scale from a small vendor to multiple services

---

## My Role

I worked as a **Full-Stack Developer**, responsible for:

- System design and feature planning
- Frontend development using Next.js
- Backend APIs and database modeling
- Authentication and authorization
- Deployment and environment configuration

---

## Solution

Tiffinz introduces a centralized platform where users and admins interact through well-defined workflows.

### User Features

- View daily tiffin status and upcoming meals
- Track wallet balance and transaction history
- Request balance top-ups
- Cancel meals with predefined charges

### Admin Features

- Manual verification of payments
- User and wallet management
- Meal scheduling and delivery tracking
- Transaction monitoring

---

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- Built using **Next.js App Router**
- Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI for consistent design
- Server-side rendering for better performance and SEO

### Backend

- Next.js API routes
- Secure role-based access for admin actions
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration

### Database

- MongoDB Atlas (free tier)
- Well-structured collections for users, wallets, transactions, and meals
- Designed to support future analytics and reporting

### Authentication

- Firebase Authentication
- Admin-only routes protected at both UI and API levels

---

## Challenges Faced

- Designing a flexible wallet system that supports daily, weekly, and monthly payments
- Preventing unauthorized access to admin routes
- Handling cancellations without breaking meal and balance consistency
- Working within free-tier limitations while keeping the system scalable

---

## What I Learned

- Designing real-world data models
- Managing role-based authorization in a production app
- Structuring a full-stack project for scalability
- Balancing feature requirements with performance and cost constraints

---

## Future Scope

- Mobile application support
- Notification system for meal updates
- Online payment gateway integration
- Monthly usage and revenue analytics
- Multi-vendor support
