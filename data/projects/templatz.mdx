# AI-Powered Formal Letter Generator (v3)

Project Case Study

## Overview

The AI-Powered Formal Letter Generator (v3) is a web-based application designed to help students and professionals create well-structured formal letters efficiently. The project evolved from a static, template-based system into an AI-driven platform capable of generating personalized formal correspondence using natural language input.

This version integrates the Gemini API to dynamically generate letters such as leave applications, permission requests, and other official documents.

---

## Problem Statement

Many students and early-career professionals face difficulties when writing formal letters due to:

- Lack of familiarity with proper structure and tone
- Repetition of similar content for routine applications
- Limited access to tools that balance guidance with flexibility

Most existing tools are either overly rigid or too complex for educational use.

---

## Solution

This project provides an AI-powered solution that:

- Generates formal letters from natural language prompts
- Maintains professional tone and structure
- Offers both AI-based generation and traditional templates
- Allows users to edit and export letters easily

The system is designed to automate the drafting process while keeping the user in control of the final output.

---

## Key Features

- AI-generated formal letters using the Gemini API
- Template-based letter creation for standard formats
- Clean and intuitive user interface
- Editable drafts with export options (copy, download, print)
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements

---

## AI Integration

The primary enhancement in version 3 is the integration of the Gemini API. User-provided prompts are converted into structured formal letters with appropriate tone, grammar, and formatting. This significantly improves usability compared to the earlier template-only approach.
