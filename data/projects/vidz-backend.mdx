# Case Study: Vidz Backend

## About the Project

**Vidz Backend** is a video hosting platform (like a mini-YouTube).

I started this project as part of the "Chai aur Code" backend course by **Hitesh Choudhary**. In the course, Hitesh Sir taught the core concepts of Node.js and Express. He built the foundation, but he left the complex features (like comments, playlists, and watch history) as **assignments** for the students.

I took on the challenge and completed all the remaining assignments to turn this into a fully working project.

## The Big Improvement: Faster Video Uploads

While building this, I solved a major speed problem.

### The Problem (The Old Way)

In the course, we learned to upload files using a tool called **Multer**. The flow looked like this:

1. **Frontend** sends the video to my **Server**.
2. My **Server** waits to receive the file, then sends it to **Cloudinary** (cloud storage).

**Why this was bad:** It was a "double trip." The video had to travel twice. For big video files, this took too long and slowed down the server.

### My Solution (The New Way)

I decided to change the code to make it faster. I created a new system using **Direct Uploads**:

1. **Frontend** asks my server for a secure "signature" (a permission key).
2. Using this key, the **Frontend** sends the video **straight to Cloudinary**.
3. My server is skipped during the heavy upload process.

### The Result

- **50% Faster:** Because the video goes directly to the cloud, the upload time was cut in half.
- **Better Performance:** My server doesn't get stuck handling heavy video files, so it runs smoother for other users.

## Key Features I Built

Besides the optimization, I completed all the course assignments:

- **Security:** Users can sign up and log in securely (using JWT).
- **Video Actions:** Users can Like videos, write Comments, and Subscribe to channels.
- **Dashboard:** A stats page that counts total views, subscribers, and likes.
- **Watch History:** The app remembers what you watched (and lets you clear your history).

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Node.js & Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **File Storage:** Cloudinary (with my custom speed improvement)
- **Tools:** Multer, JWT (for security)

## How to Run This Project

If you want to test the code on your own computer:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- A MongoDB account (or local database)
- A Cloudinary account

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the code:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sonu-shivcharan/vidz-backend.git
cd vidz-backend

```

2. **Install the tools:**

```bash
npm install

```

3. **Setup your passwords (.env file):**
   Create a file named `.env` and add your details:

```env
PORT=8000
MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_url
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=some_random_password
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_secret

```

4. **Start the server:**

```bash
npm run dev

```
